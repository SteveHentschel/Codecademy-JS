//  I see that JavaScript already has 'substring' and 'substr' methods built-in,
//      but it's nice to build one yourself and see how they might work with recursion.

var substring = function(all, start, end)   {
    
    if (start >= end)   {
        return (all[start]);
    }
    else    {
        return all[start] + substring(all, start+1, end);
    }

console.log(substring("My quick brown fox has spots.", 19, 27));
